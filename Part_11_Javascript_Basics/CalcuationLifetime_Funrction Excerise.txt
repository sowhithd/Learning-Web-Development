/*
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years
old.
It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
For this challenge, assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
*/

Solution:

function lifeInWeeks(currentAge) {
    var yearsRemaning = 90 - currentAge;
    var daysRemaning = yearsRemaning * 365;
    var weeksRemaning = yearsRemaning * 52;
    var monthsRemaning = yearsRemaning * 12;
    
     console.log("You have " + daysRemaning + " days," + weeksRemaning + " weeks, and " +monthsRemaning+ " months left");
}
lifeInWeeks(29);
