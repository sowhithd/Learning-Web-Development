Who's Buying Lunch? Code Challenge:

You are going to write a function which will select a random name from a list of names. 
The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

Example Input:
["Angela", "Ben", "Jenny", "Michael", "Chloe"]

Example Output:
Michael is going to buy lunch today!

Hint:
1. You might need to think about Array.length.
2. Remember that Arrays start at position 0!

Code Snippet:

function whosPaying(names) {
var peopleWentToLunch = names;
var randomIndex = getRandomArrayIndex(peopleWentToLunch.length);
console.log(peopleWentToLunch[randomIndex] + " is going to buy lunch today");
}

function getRandomArrayIndex(arrayLength) {
 return Math.floor(Math.random()*arrayLength);
}

whosPaying(["Angela", "Ben", "Jenny", "Michael", "Chloe"]);
